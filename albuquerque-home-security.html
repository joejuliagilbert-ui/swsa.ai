<h2>Residential Security Systems for Albuquerque Homes</h2>
<p>
Most Albuquerque homeowners want the same outcomes: clear alerts, reliable entry protection, and camera coverage at the places that matter.
A well-planned security system typically starts with the front door and garage entry, then expands to other doors, windows, and high-traffic areas based on the home layout.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADT security system installation</strong> for residential properties</li>
<li><strong>Door and window sensors</strong> for entry protection</li>
<li><strong>Motion detection</strong> for key interior areas (configured to match your household)</li>
<li><strong>Glass break detection</strong> for vulnerable rooms and large windows</li>
<li><strong>Smart locks</strong> for controlled access and simplified entry</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security Cameras and Doorbell Cameras in Albuquerque</h2>
<p>
Many customers want visible camera coverage at entry points and clear video for the driveway, front walk, and backyard access.
I install and configure cameras for practical coverage and usability, including notification settings and basic troubleshooting guidance.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Doorbell cameras</strong> for front-door visibility and visitor alerts</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor cameras</strong> for driveways, yards, gates, and garages</li>
<li><strong>Indoor cameras</strong> for common areas when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>Camera placement planning</strong> focused on real sightlines and daily use</li>
</ul>

<h2>Smart Home Integration (Practical and Simple)</h2>
<p>
If you want the system to fit into your daily routine, basic smart home integration can help.
The focus is always practical outcomes: easy entry, clear notifications, and simple routines that reduce confusion and false alarms.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Smart locks + security</strong> setup for controlled access</li>
<li><strong>Basic automation</strong> that supports security use (simple, reliable routines)</li>
<li><strong>Third-party device help</strong> when appropriate (practical setup and training)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Expect (Install Process)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick intake</strong>: a few questions about your home layout, entry points, and goals.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage plan</strong>: decide what devices matter most and where they should go.</li>
<li><strong>Install day</strong>: careful placement, correct configuration, and confirmation testing.</li>
<li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: learn arming/disarming, app basics, camera viewing, and user management.</li>
<li><strong>Support expectations</strong>: clear guidance on what you can self-manage and what needs formal support.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ (Albuquerque Home Security)</h2>

<h3>Do you install in Albuquerque, NM?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Call or text and I will confirm availability and scheduling for your area in Albuquerque.
</p>

<h3>Can I start small and expand later?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Many systems start with entry protection and a doorbell camera, then expand with additional cameras, sensors, or smart locks.
</p>

<h3>Do I need cameras, monitoring, or both?</h3>
<p>
They solve different problems. Cameras help you see what happened; monitoring and sensors help detect and alert based on events.
I can help you choose a setup that matches your goals and budget.
