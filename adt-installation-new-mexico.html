<p>
If you are looking for <strong>ADT installation in New Mexico</strong>, I provide residential security system installation across <strong>Albuquerque</strong>, <strong>Santa Fe</strong>, <strong>Farmington</strong>, and the <strong>Four Corners</strong>. The focus is practical coverage, clean installs, and a system that is easy to use every day.
</p>

<h2>What a Practical ADT Setup Includes</h2>
<p>
Most homes start with entry protection and expand based on layout and goals. A properly configured system typically includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Door and window sensors</strong> for entry protection</li>
<li><strong>Motion detection</strong> in key interior areas (placed to avoid nuisance alerts)</li>
<li><strong>Glass break detection</strong> where large windows or sliding doors create risk</li>
<li><strong>Smart locks</strong> for controlled entry and user management (when desired)</li>
<li><strong>Camera options</strong> based on sightlines and real entry points</li>
</ul>

<p>
If cameras are a priority, see: <a href="security-cameras-new-mexico.html"><strong>security cameras in New Mexico</strong></a>.
</p>

<h2>Service Areas in New Mexico</h2>
<p>
I focus on installs in the following areas (call/text to confirm scheduling and availability):
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="albuquerque-home-security.html"><strong>Albuquerque, NM</strong></a> (home security installation and camera coverage)</li>
<li><a href="santa-fe-home-security.html"><strong>Santa Fe, NM</strong></a> (entry protection, cameras, and walkthrough training)</li>
<li><a href="farmington-home-security.html"><strong>Farmington, NM</strong></a> (home base + surrounding Four Corners communities)</li>
<li><a href="durango-home-security.html"><strong>Durango, CO</strong></a> (Four Corners coverage)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick intake</strong>: a few questions about layout, entry points, and goals</li>
<li><strong>Coverage planning</strong>: decide what devices matter most and where they should go</li>
<li><strong>Professional installation</strong>: clean placement, careful setup, and confirmation testing</li>
<li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: app + panel training so you can confidently use the system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Professional Installation Matters</h2>
<p>
Placement and configuration determine whether a system is helpful or frustrating. The goal is meaningful coverage, fewer nuisance alerts, and a setup that matches your routine. A clean install and clear walkthrough are part of the job—not an afterthought.
