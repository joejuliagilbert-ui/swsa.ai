<p>
If you are looking for <strong>security cameras in New Mexico</strong>, I install and configure camera coverage designed for real entry points and usable sightlines.
Most homeowners want a simple outcome: clear video at the places that matter, alerts that are not constant noise, and a setup that is easy to view and manage.
</p>

<p>
I commonly work with customers in <strong>Albuquerque</strong>, <strong>Santa Fe</strong>, <strong>Farmington</strong>, and <strong>Durango</strong>, and I can help you plan camera coverage based on your layout and goals.

<h2>Google Nest Cameras (High-Signal Features)</h2>
<p>
If you are already in the Google ecosystem, <strong>Google Nest cameras and doorbells</strong> are a strong option because they prioritize meaningful alerts over constant motion noise.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart object detection</strong>: can distinguish people, vehicles, animals, and packages (supported models), which reduces false alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Activity zones</strong>: alerts can be limited to specific areas like a driveway, porch, or gate rather than the entire frame.</li>
<li><strong>Event-based history</strong>: recordings can be filtered by event type (for faster review and less scrolling).</li>
<li><strong>Smart home integration</strong>: works well with Google Home app and Nest displays for quick viewing and announcements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: some advanced features require a <strong>Nest Aware</strong> subscription (event history length and certain intelligent alerts).
</p>

<h2>What Most Homeowners Actually Need</h2>
<p>
Most homes do not need cameras everywhere. The highest ROI coverage usually starts with:
front entry, driveway, garage access, backyard access points, and any side gates or hidden approaches.
From there, you expand based on blind spots and daily routine.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front entry coverage</strong> (doorbell camera or front-facing outdoor camera)</li>
<li><strong>Driveway visibility</strong> (approach and vehicle area)</li>
<li><strong>Garage access</strong> (door and side access points)</li>
<li><strong>Backyard and gate access</strong> (common break-in routes)</li>
<li><strong>Low-light considerations</strong> (usable video after dark)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Doorbell Cameras</h2>
<p>
Doorbell cameras are a common first step because they create visibility and deterrence at the main entry point.
A good setup includes correct angle, usable night visibility, and notifications that do not become overwhelming.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visitor alerts</strong> and front-door awareness</li>
<li><strong>Package visibility</strong> and delivery monitoring</li>
<li><strong>Placement and angle planning</strong> for usable video</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outdoor Security Cameras</h2>
<p>
Outdoor cameras provide broader perimeter awareness. The focus is usable sightlines and positioning that matches approach paths.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Driveways</strong> and vehicle areas</li>
<li><strong>Yards</strong>, gates, and side paths</li>
<li><strong>Garages</strong> and outbuildings</li>
<li><strong>Back doors</strong> and sliding doors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indoor Cameras (When Appropriate)</h2>
<p>
Indoor cameras are not needed for every home, but they can help in certain situations: common areas, entry hallways, or areas where you want event confirmation.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common areas</strong> where events would be visible</li>
<li><strong>Entry hallways</strong> as a secondary confirmation layer</li>
<li><strong>Selective placement</strong> based on household comfort</li>
</ul>

<h2>Camera Placement Planning (The Difference Maker)</h2>
<p>
Placement matters more than the number of cameras. A good plan reduces false alerts and increases usable video.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sightlines</strong> that capture faces and approach paths</li>
<li><strong>Height and angle</strong> chosen for usable video</li>
<li><strong>Lighting</strong> and night performance considerations</li>
<li><strong>Alert configuration</strong> to reduce noise</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ – Security Cameras in New Mexico</h2>

<h3>How many cameras do I need?</h3>
<p>
Most homes start with 1–3 cameras covering front entry, driveway, and a key backyard or side access point. We expand based on blind spots.
</p>

<h3>Should I start with a doorbell camera or an outdoor camera?</h3>
<p>
Many homeowners start with a doorbell camera for front entry visibility. If the driveway or yard approach is more important, an outdoor camera may come first.
</p>

<h3>Can you help me choose placements before install?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Placement planning is one of the highest value parts of a camera system.
</p>
