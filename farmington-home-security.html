<p>
If you are looking for <strong>home security installation in Farmington, NM</strong>, I install residential security systems and practical smart home solutions designed for real coverage and simple daily use. Farmington is my home base, so scheduling is often fastest here and across the Four Corners region.
</p>

<p>
Statewide overview: <a href="adt-installation-new-mexico.html"><strong>ADT installation in New Mexico</strong></a>.
</p>

<h2>Farmington Home Security Systems (ADT)</h2>
<p>
A strong security setup starts with the basics: protect primary entry points, reduce blind spots, and make sure the system is easy to operate. For many Farmington homes, a good starter system includes door and window sensors, a doorbell camera or front-entry camera, and layered detection where it makes sense.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADT security system installation</strong> for homes and apartments</li>
<li><strong>Door and window sensors</strong> for entry protection</li>
<li><strong>Motion detection</strong> for key interior areas</li>
<li><strong>Glass break detection</strong> for vulnerable rooms</li>
<li><strong>Smart locks</strong> for controlled entry and simplified access management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security Cameras in Farmington</h2>
<p>
Most Farmington camera installs focus on front entry, driveway, garage access, backyard gates, and other high-value access points. I plan placement for usable sightlines and help you configure alerts so you actually benefit from the system day-to-day.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Doorbell cameras</strong> for front door visibility</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor cameras</strong> for perimeter and access points</li>
<li><strong>Indoor cameras</strong> for common areas when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>Camera setup</strong> focused on practical notifications and viewing</li>
</ul>
