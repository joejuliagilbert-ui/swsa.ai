<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>
I focus on residential security and smart home installs that are practical, reliable, and easy to maintain.
Most customers want coverage for doors and windows, the main living areas, and clear camera visibility at entry points.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security system installation (ADT)</strong> for homes and apartments</li>
  <li><a href="adt-installation-new-mexico.html"><strong>ADT Installation in New Mexico</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Doorbell cameras</strong> (front door visibility and visitor alerts)</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor cameras</strong> (driveways, yards, gates, garages)</li>
<li><strong>Indoor cameras</strong> (common areas as needed)</li>
<li><strong>Door and window sensors</strong> (entry protection)</li>
<li><strong>Motion and glass break detection</strong> (layered coverage)</li>
<li><strong>Smart locks</strong> (controlled entry and simple user management)</li>
<li><strong>Basic smart home integration</strong> (practical automations, not “gimmicks”)</li>
<li><strong>System walkthrough</strong> so you can confidently use the app and panel</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are comparing options (including Vivint or any other provider), I keep the conversation simple:
what are you trying to protect, what’s your layout, where are the real entry points, and what coverage will actually matter day-to-day.

<h2 id="process">What to Expect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick intake</strong>: I ask a few questions about your home layout, entry points, and goals (security, cameras, smart locks, or all of the above).</li>
<li><strong>Coverage plan</strong>: we decide what devices matter most and where they should go for real coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Install day</strong>: clean placement, careful setup, and confirmation that everything is working as expected.</li>
<li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: I show you how to arm/disarm, use the app, view cameras, manage users, and test sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Support expectations</strong>: I explain what you can handle yourself, and what should be handled through the proper support channel if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
My goal is that you end the install with a system that makes sense, is easy to operate, and is configured to match your real daily routine.
</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Do you install in Albuquerque and Santa Fe?</h3>
<p>
Yes. If you are in Albuquerque or Santa Fe, call or text and I will confirm availability and scheduling.
</p>

<h3>Do you install in Farmington and Durango?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Farmington is my home base, and I also take installs in Durango and the Four Corners region.
</p>

<h3>What is the best starter system?</h3>
<p>
For most homes, the best start is basic entry protection (doors/windows) plus a doorbell camera or a front-entry outdoor camera.
From there, you expand based on your layout and what you actually want to monitor.
</p>

<h3>Can I add cameras, sensors, or smart locks later?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Many customers start with core protection and expand later once they live with the system and understand what they want next.
</p>

<h3>Do cameras require monitoring?</h3>
<p>
Not always. Monitoring and cameras solve different problems. I can help you decide what makes sense for your goals and budget.
</p>

<h3>Will the system work if Wi-Fi goes out?</h3>
<p>
Your setup depends on the equipment in the home. When we plan the install, I explain what uses Wi-Fi, what does not, and what backup options exist.
</p>

<h3>How do I get a quote?</h3>
<p>
Call or text me with your city and what you want (security, cameras, smart lock, or a mix). I’ll ask a few quick questions and give you a clear next step.
